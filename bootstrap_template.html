        <h1>The Telling History of Gas Prices in America</h1>
        <p>Examining and Explaining the Recent Rise of Gas Prices Throughout the Country</p>

        <p> Gas prices in this country have risen to record-breaking highs, with 2022 surpassing 2008 for the most expensive year in the history of the United States. On March 10th, the average price in America was four dollars and thirty-three cents, with prices in high-demand areas like Los-Angeles and Las Vegas nearing six dollars per gallon. Not only have these prices made everyday life more difficult for some, but they have incited anger and division in the American political sphere.

          Republicans are lashing out on the current government and specifically President Joe Biden himself, placing the blame on his leadership. Criticizers say that, because Biden has slowed production and drilling of fossil fuels, causing gasoline prices to spike. In reality, president Biden has not slowed down production at all. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/dont-blame-biden-for-gas-prices.html">The number of oil rigs are actually increasing,<a/> and Biden has produced more barrels of oil in his first year of presidency than Donald Trump. Even if Biden did decrease production of crude oil, his involvement has little to do with the price of a gallon. </p>
          <p>
            When the pandemic hit, demand for oil came to a screeching halt. Production slowed down to an amount that when the world began to open back up in 2021, it was hard for companies to fulfill demand and produce on all cylinders again. As travel boomed and people began to do everything they couldn't in the previous year, demand soared and it was impossible for companies to pick up where they left off, as it takes months to restart old wells and drill new ones. Thus, the demand was higher than the supply, raising prices. </p>
          <p>
            Then, Russia invaded Ukraine. Just behind the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Russia is one of the biggest oil producers in the world. In an attempt to cut off Russian profits, much of the western world has installed sanctions, cutting off the use of Russian oil and thus decreasing supply even more. These sanctions, that the GOP supported, were decisions made by the government in attempts to slow down the Russian government. The adverse effects being higher prices in America. </p>
            <p>
              Devashish Mitra, a Professor of Economics & Gerald B. and Daphna Cramer Professor of Global Affairs in The Maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs at Syracuse University says prices are unlikely to fall anytime soon. He names high prices as one of the main local effects of the overseas war. As oil is one of the most dependable products in terms of supply and demand, halting imports from one of the biggest producers means unavoidable spikes in cost. </p>

        <p>This is not the first time that tensions abroad have caused prices to change in the U.S. <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/10/gas-prices-record-high-inflation-wage-growth-oil/#:~:text=The%20spike%20in%20oil%20prices,steadily%20climb%20over%20the%202000s">As costs rose to around four dollars on average in July of 2008,<a/> factors like a decade long-energy crisis and tension in The Middle East were to blame. Again, there was more demand than supply at the time, and thus prices were forced up by oil companies.</p>

        The rule of supply and demand, often influenced by outside factors, is different in this instance. While some Americans are complaining about the prices of gas in their states and blaming President Biden, they fail to realize that, unlike 2008, prices are so high because we made that sacrifice in order to support Ukraine. If no sanctions were made, there is no doubt that prices would be much lower. But, without sanctions the U.S. would be actively providing Russia with profits that would help them fight and kill innocent Ukranians. This is a decision made by the government that, for once, was supported by the vast majority of lawmakers.</p>
        <p>
          While the war in Ukraine rages on and Covid-19 still lurks in the background, prices are not expected to go down anytime soon, Mitra said. Even as many countries cut off imports and exports from Russia, and major worldwide corporations remove all activity from the area, it is unknown whether or not Russia will feel any loss from the loss of profits. </p>
          <p>
            The rise and fall of gas prices in America is hard to predict, but they will always be an ever-changing resource. It is likely that years down the line, there could be another pandemic or another war or another factor that pushes prices one way or another. While political parties become increasingly partisan, gas prices are a sensitive subject to all. Inflation as a whole in America continues to climb, but when it takes 50 dollars to fill the tank of an average car, how the economy is changing is hard to ignore. While President Biden and the government as a whole claims to try to reduce costs as much as possible, the consequences of a global pandemic and the loss of 12% of global oil supply is not an easy fix. As prices continue to climb, Americans continue to struggle with getting where they need to go.
